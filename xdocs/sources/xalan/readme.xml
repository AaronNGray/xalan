   </ul>
   <p>If you want to rebuild &xslt4c; (to produce a debug build, for example), you need the following:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>The &xslt4c; source files</li>
     <li>The &xml4c; header and (for Windows) .lib files</li>
     <li>(Optional) The ICU header and (for Windows) .lib files</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The &xslt4c; source files are in the distribution.</p>
   <p>The required &xml4c; files are in the &xml4c; binary distributions.</p>
   <p>For information on using the <resource-ref idref="icu"/>, see  
   <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>.</p>
   <note>If you are not rebuilding with the ICU, you do not need the ICU header or .lib files.</note>
   <p>To rebuild the Windows32 release, use the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project files. To rebuild
    the Linux or AIX release, use the make file in the root of the source directory. The builds look
    for &xml4c; and ICU in directories parallel to the
    xml-xalan directory.</p>
    </s3><anchor name="layout"/>
    <s3 title="Layout">
   <p><em>Important</em> We have set up the Visual C++ projects and the Linux and AIX make files to look for Xerces in a directory structure that results from downloading xml-xerces/c from the <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/websrc/cvsweb.cgi/">Apache XML CVS repository</jump> and building with the Visual C++ project files or the Linux make file. This structure parallels the &xslt4c; source tree and build structure.</p>
<p>If you are using a &xml4c; binary distribution, you must either modify the &xslt4c; project files or makefile, or rearrange the build directory structure as indicated in the following illustration.</p>
<p>For Linux and AIX, the XERCESROOT environment variable points to the Xerces-C root directory. For Windows, the Xerces-C root directory must be named xml-xerces, and it must be at the same level as the &xslt4c; root directory. For all environments, the ICU root directory must be named icu, and it must be at the same level as the &xslt4c; root directory.</p>
<s4 title="&xml4c; and ICU layout for &xslt4c; build">
<p><img src="xerces-icu.gif" alt="xerces-icu.gif"/></p>
</s4>
<note>Keep in mind that at any given point in time the &xslt4c; and &xml4c; source trees in the Apache XML repository may not be consistent. When we release a version of &xslt4c; we certify that it is compatible with a given release of &xml4c;. To be safe, stick with distributions that we certify to be compatible. Reminder: &xslt4c-current; is compatible with &xml4c-used;.<br/><br/>
&xslt4c-current; has been tested with &icu-used;. You may be able to use newer ICU releases as they appear.</note>
  </s3><anchor name="win32"/>
  <s3 title="Steps for doing a Windows build">
  <ol>
    <li>Rearrange the &xml4c; binary distribution as indicated above so the headers are in
     the xml-xerces/c/src tree and xml-xerces is at the same level as the xml-xerces root
     directory.<br/><br/></li>
     <li>(Optional) If you are rebuilding the ICUBridge, install the ICU so the icu root directory
      is at the same level as the xml-xerces root directory (see <link 
      idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>.<br/><br/>
      If you want TestXSLT to use ICU support for number formatting and sorting, install the ICU,
      uncomment the <code>#define XALAN_USE_ICU</code> statement in process.cpp, and use the Visual C++ 
      Project Dependencies command to add ICUBridge to the list of TestXSLT dependencies (see <link idref="commandline"
      anchor="icu">Enabling ICU support for TestXSLT</link>).<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Use Visual C++ to open the Xalan workspace from the xml-xalan\c\Projects\Win32\VC6.
    <br/><br/></li>
    <li>Select Project Dependencies and check <br/><br/></li>
    <li>Use Visual C++ to rebuild everything or specific dynamic link libraries and executables of
    interest.<br/><br/></li>
  </ol>
  </s3><anchor name="unix"/>
<s3 title="Steps for doing a Linux or AIX build">
    <ol>
      <li>Rearrange the &xml4c; binary distribution as indicated above so the headers are in the
        <ref>xerces-c_x_y_z-platform</ref>/c/src tree, and set the XERCESCROOT environment variable
        to the complete path to <ref>xerces-c_x_y_z-platform</ref>.<br/><br/></li>    
      <li>Set the XALANCROOT environment variable to the complete path to the root of the &xslt4c;
       distribution.<br/><br/></li>
      <li>AIX only: Download <resource-ref idref="stlport"/> and set the STLPORTROOT environment
       variable to the complete path to the STLPort distribution. <br/>
       (This step is not required for Linux because The Linux GNU compiler includes the STL (Standard Template
        Library.)<br/><br/></li>
      <li>(Optional) If you are including the ICUBridge, install the ICU (see <link idref="usagepatterns"
      anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>) and define XALAN_USE_ICU.<br/><br/></li>
      <li>Change directory to xml-xalan/c/src in the &xslt4c; distribution.<br/><br/></li>      
      <li>Use the chmod +x command to set the executable flags for conf* and
       runConfigure.<br/><br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>chmod +x runConfigure</code><br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>chmod +x conf*</code><br/><br/></li>
      <li>Run the runConfigure utility with at least the platform flag (Linux) or the platform, C compilier, and C++ compiler flags (AIX) as indicated below.<br/><br/>
      <ref>Linux:</ref>&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>runConfigure -p linux</code><br/>
      <ref>AIX:</ref>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>runConfigure -p aix -c xlc_r -x xlC_r</code><br/><br/>
      To see the other runConfigure flags you may include, use the help flag:<br/><br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>runConfigure -h</code><br/><br/></li>
      <li>Purge the previous build:<br/><br/>
         <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make clean</code><br/><br/></li>
      <li>Run the new build:<br/><br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>make</code><br/>
      or<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>make <ref>targ</ref></code><br/><br/>
      where <ref>targ</ref> is ommitted or is <code>all</code> (rebuild all), <code>lib</code> (the XSLT libary), or
      <code>TestXSLT</code> (the TestSXSLT executable). ICUBridge is included in the build of TestXSLT if XALAN_USE_ICU is
      defined.<br/><br/></li>
    </ol>
    <note>The command you use for setting environment variables depends on the shell you are
     using.<br/>
     For Bourne Shell, K Shell, or Bash use <em>export</em> ENVAR "val"<br/>
     For C Shell, use <em>setenv</em> ENVAR="val"<br/>
     where ENVAR is the environment variable name and val is the environment variable
     setting. You can check the setting of an environment variable with <em>echo</em> $ENVAR</note>
   </s3><anchor name="samples"/>
   <s3 title="Rebuilding a sample application">
   <p>The Windows32 distribution includes Visual C++ project files for each of the sample applications. The project files are in the samples subdirectories along with the source files. If you modify a sample and want to recompile it, you can recompile the .cpp file(s) and rebuild the executable.</p>
<p>The make files that come with the Linux and AIX distributions include targets for rebuilding one or all of the sample applications (with the exception of the ThreadSafe sample, which in its current form only runs under Windows). To rebuild one or more sample applications, go to the xml-xalan/c/src directory and run<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>make <ref>targ</ref></code><br/><br/>
where <ref>targ</ref> is <code>Samples</code> (all the samples), <code>CompileStylesheet</code>, <code>ExternalFunction</code>, <code>SimpleTransform</code>, <code>TraceListen</code>, <code>UseStylesheetParam</code>, or <code>XPathWrapper</code>.</p>
