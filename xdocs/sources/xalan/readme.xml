   <s3 title="Rebuilding &xslt4c;">
   <p>To rebuild the Windows32 release, use the Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 project files. To rebuild the Linux release, use the make file in the root of the source directory.</p>
   <p><em>Important</em> We have set up the Visual C++ projects and the Linux make file to look for Xerces in a the directory structure that results from downloading xml-xerces/c from the Apache XML repository and building with the Visual C++ project files or the Linux make file. This structure parallels the Xalan-C source tree and build structure.<br/><br/>
If you are using a Xerces-C binary distribution, you must either modify the Xalan-C project files or makefile, or rearrange the build directory structure, and you must also get the header files from the Xerces-C source distribution, since Xalan-C uses a header file that is not included in the Xerces-C binary distribution.</p>
<note>Keep in mind that at any given point in time the Xalan-C and Xerces-C source trees in the Apache XML repository may not be consistent. When we release a version of Xerces-C we certify that it is compabible with a given release of Xalan-C. To be safe, stick with distributions that we certify to be compatible. Reminder: Xalan-C 1.0.0 is compatible with Xerces-C 1.1.0.</note>
   </s3><anchor name="samples"/>
   <s3 title="Rebuilding a sample application">
   <p>The Windows32 distribution includes Visual C++ project files for each of the sample applications. The project files are in the samples subdirectories along with the source files. If you modify a sample and want to recompile it, you can recompile the .cpp file(s) and rebuild the executable.</p>
<p>The Linux distribution does not yet include make files for the sample applications, so you must construct your own Linux make files and build the sample executables.</p>
