     <p>All known &xslt4c; bugs are listed in <resource-ref idref="bugzilla"/>. For a list of open bugs with links to each bug
      report, see <resource-ref idref="buglist"/>. If you find a new bug, please enter a XalanC bug report in this
      database.</p>
     <note>Before you can enter your first bug report, you must submit your email address to Bugzilla and receive a password.</note> 
     <p>We strongly encourage you write patches for problems you find and submit them to
      xalan-dev@xml.apache.org. We review the patches we receive to make sure they do not break something else, and (assuming they 
     do not) include them in our next release. In the interest of fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and addressing outstanding design
     issues, we sincerely want (and need!) your active participation in the ongoing development of Xalan.</p>

   <s3 title="What you need from the distributions">
   <p>To rebuild &xslt4c;, you need the &xslt4c; source files, the &xml4c; header files, and
   for Windows the &xml4c; .lib file. If you want to rebuild with the ICU, you also need the ICU header files, and for Windows the ICU .lib file.</p>
  <p>The &xslt4c; source tree is in the src subdirectory of the &xslt4c; <link idref="getstarted" anchor="download">binary distributions</link>. The &xml4c; header files are in the include/xercesc tree of the corresponding &xml4c; binary distributions. The Windows Xerces .lib file is in the lib directory of the &xml4c; Windows binary distribution.</p> 

<note>You can also download &xslt4c; source distributions from <resource-ref idref="xslt4c-distdir"/>: &xslt4c-dist;-src.zip and &xslt4c-dist;-src.tar.gz. &xml4c; source distributions are available from <resource-ref idref="xml4c-distdir"/>: 
&xml4c-dist;-src.zip and &xml4c-dist;-src.tar.gz.</note>
<p>Keep in mind that at any given point in time the &xslt4c; and &xml4c; source trees in the Apache XML repository may not be consistent. When we release a version of &xslt4c; we certify that it is compatible with a given version of &xml4c;. To be safe, stick with Xerces distributions that we certify to be compatible. Reminder: &xslt4c-current; is compatible with &xml4c-used;.</p>
   <p>For information on using the <resource-ref idref="icu"/>, see
   <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>.
   &xslt4c-current; has been tested with &icu-used;. You may be able to use newer ICU releases as they appear.</p>
   </s3><anchor name="win32"/>
  <s3 title="Steps for doing a Windows build">
  <p>To build &xslt4c; on Windows, you need &xml4c; and MS Visual C++ 6.0 installed with Service Pack 3 for Visual C++ and Visual Studio. You should also apply the bug fixes for the C++ standard library that shipped with Visual C++ 6.0. These fixes are available from the Dinkumware site: <jump href="http://www.dinkumware.com/vc_fixes.html">http://www.dinkumware.com/vc_fixes.html</jump>.</p> 
  <p>If you do not want to apply the Dinkumware patches, or you are using a different Service Pack, you must rebuild all of the Xerces and Xalan binaries.</p>
<p>Before you do the following, be sure you have <link idref="getstarted" anchor="windowspath">provided Visual C++ the paths to the Xerces headers and libraries</link>.</p>
  <ol>    
     <li>(Optional) If you are rebuilding the ICUBridge, install the ICU so the icu root directory
      is at the same level as the xml-xerces root directory (see <link 
      idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>.<br/><br/>
      If you want the Xalan and/or testXSLT executable to use ICU support for number formatting and sorting, install the ICU,
      uncomment the <code>#define XALAN_USE_ICU</code> statement in process.cpp, and use the Visual C++ 
      Project Dependencies command to add ICUBridge to the list of XalanTransformer and/or TestXSLT dependencies (see <link idref="commandline"
      anchor="icu">Enabling ICU support for the Xalan and/or TestXSLT executable</link>).<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Use Visual C++ to open the Xalan workspace from the xml-xalan\c\Projects\Win32\VC6.
    <br/><br/></li>
    <li>Use Visual C++ to rebuild everything or specific dynamic link libraries and executables of
    interest.</li>
  </ol>
  </s3><anchor name="unix"/>
<s3 title="Steps for doing a UNIX build">
    <ol>
      <li>The Xalan build files are written for GNU make, and will not work with other make utilities.<br/><br/></li>    
      <li>Set the XERCESCROOT environment variable to the path to the root of &xml4c;.<br/><br/></li>    
      <li>Set the XALANCROOT environment variable to the path to the c directory in the root of the &xslt4c;
       distribution.  For example, if the distribution is located in "/home/xalan", you would set the XALANCROOT to "/home/xalan/xml-xalan/c". <br/><br/></li>
      <li>(Optional) If you are including the ICUBridge, install the ICU, use the shell to define XALAN_USE_ICU and to set the ICUROOT environment variable to the path to the ICU root. For more information, see (see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>)<br/><br/></li>
      <li>Change directory to xml-xalan/c/src in the &xslt4c; distribution.<br/><br/></li>      
      <li>Run the runConfigure utility with at least the platform flag (Linux) or the platform, C compilier, and C++ compiler flags (AIX) as indicated below.<br/><br/>
      <ref>Linux:</ref>&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>./runConfigure -p linux</code><br/>
      <ref>AIX:</ref>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>./runConfigure -p aix -c xlc -x xlC</code><br/><br/>
      <ref>HP-UX 11 (32 bit):</ref>&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>./runConfigure -p hp-11 -c cc -x aCC</code><br/><br/>
      <ref>HP-UX 11 (64 bit):</ref>&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>./runConfigure -p hp-11 -c cc -x aCC -b 64</code><br/><br/>
      <ref>Solaris:</ref>&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>./runConfigure -p Solaris -c cc -x CC</code><br/><br/>            
      To see the other runConfigure flags you may include, use the help flag:<br/><br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>./runConfigure -h</code><br/><br/></li>
      <li>Purge the previous build:<br/><br/>
         <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make clean</code><br/><br/></li>
      <li>Run the new build:<br/><br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>make</code><br/>
      or<br/>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>make <ref>targ</ref></code><br/><br/>
      where <ref>targ</ref> is omitted or is <code>all</code> (rebuild all), <code>lib</code> (the XSLT library), <code>Xalan</code> (the Xalan executable), or
      <code>testXSLT</code> (the testXSLT executable). ICUBridge is included in the build of Xalan and TestXSLT if XALAN_USE_ICU is
      defined.<br/><br/></li>
    </ol><anchor name="64"/>
    <note>64-bit builds for AIX and Solaris have not yet been tested. To perform such a build, you must use the corresponding 64-bit Xerces distribution and run the runConfigure script with the -b 64 option (as indicated above for the HP-UX 11 64-bit build).</note>
   </s3><anchor name="samples"/>
   <s3 title="Rebuilding a sample application">
   <p>The Windows32 distribution includes a Visual C++ workspace for the sample applications. This workspace is in the samples directory. If you modify a sample and want to recompile it, you can recompile the .cpp file(s) and rebuild the executable.</p>
<p>The Makefile that come with the UNIX distributions include targets for rebuilding one or all of the sample applications (with the exception of the ThreadSafe sample, which in its current form only runs under Windows). To rebuild one or more sample applications, go to the xml-xalan/c/src directory and run<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>gmake <ref>targ</ref></code><br/><br/>
where <ref>targ</ref> is <code>Samples</code> (all the samples), <code>XalanTransform</code>, <code>SimpleTransform</code>,  <code>StreamTransform</code>, <code>UseStylesheetParam</code>, <code>TraceListen</code>, <code>CompileStylesheet</code>, (Windows only) <code>ThreadSafe</code>  <code>XPathWrapper</code>, <code>ExternalFunctions</code>,or <code>ApacheModuleXSLT</code>.</p>
