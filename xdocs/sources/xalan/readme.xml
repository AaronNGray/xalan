   <s3 title="Rebuilding &xslt4c;">
   <p>the Xalan-C dynamic link libraries and command-line executable.</p>
     <p>The &xslt4c; build is in xalan.jar. The &xslt4c; source code tree is in the src directory.
     If you want to rebuild xalan.jar, you can do the following:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Set up GNU or the equivalent build environment on your workstation.<br/><br/>
       If you are running Windows 95/98/2000/NT, you can use the Cygwin port of GNU. Be sure to put the
       appropriate Cygwin bin directory at the beginning of your system path. For information about
       Cygwin, see <jump href="http://www.sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</jump>.<br/><br/></li>
       <li>Place <resource-ref idref="xerces-used"/> xerces.jar in the Java class path.<br/><br/></li>
       <li>If you are working in Windows, set MAKE_MODE as follows:<br/><br/>
       <code>set MAKE_MODE=UNIX</code><br/><br/></li>
       <li>Run the make file in the &xslt4c; root directory:<br/><br/>
       <code>make build</code><br/><br/></li>
     </ol>
     <p>If you want to do the build without the GNU build environment, keep the following in mind:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>Set the class path to include the src directory, xerces.jar, bsf.jar, and bsfengines.jar.</li>
     <li>Use a Java compiler (such as the IBM Just-In-Time compiler or the Sun javac) to compile all the .java files in the src
     tree. </li>
     <li>Use the Sun jar utility to store the resulting .class files in xalan.jar</li>
     </ul>
   </s3><anchor name="samples"/>
   <s3 title="Rebuilding a sample application">
   <p>If you modify a sample and want to recompile it, you can run the Java compiler in the directory containing the
   example. Be sure xalan.jar and xerces.jar are on the class path. To recompile (and run!) the class files in the
   Servlet subdirectory, the javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages must also be on the class path. Sun
   distributes these packages in the JSWDK 1.0.1 servlet.jar file.</p> 
   <p>After recompiling a sample, you can use the Sun jar utility to place your new .class files in
    xalansamples.jar.</p>
   </s3><anchor name="doc"/>

 <s2 title="Getting in Touch">
  <p>Your feedback is more than welcome. Offers of help are even more so! Perhaps you would like to contribute to the ongoing development, testing, or documentation of &xslt4c;?</p> 
<p>Please email your comments, questions, suggestions, bug reports, and offers to help to <human-resource-ref idref="xalandev"/>.</p>
