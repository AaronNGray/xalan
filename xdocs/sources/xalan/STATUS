<s3 title="Version of Xerces to use"> 
<p>Xalan-C version 1.0.0 has been tested with Xerces-C version 1.1.0. The Xalan-C 1.1.0 Windows32 download includes xerces-c_1_1.dll. The Xalan-C 1.1.0 Linux download includes libxerces-c_1_1.so.

<p><em>Important</em> You may experience unpredictable anomalies if your Xalan and Xerces builds are not in synch. If you download an update to Xalan, check the release notes to determine which version of Xerces you should use.</p>

<s3 title="To-do tasks for future Xalan releases">
  <p>We still need to do the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Implement a more efficient mechanism for storing and navigating DOM trees, along the lines of the Xalan-J
       Document Table Model )<br/><br/>(DTM)<br/><br/></li>
       <li>Provide a debugging interface to enable the tracing of transformation events<br/><br/></li>
      <li>Add support for extension elements<br/><br/></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Watch the <human-resource-ref idref="xalandev"/> for more information and for ideas about how you can get involved.</p>
