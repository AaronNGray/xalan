<s2 title="Using a command-line utility">
<p>To perform a transformation, you can call &xslt4c; from the command line (or script), 
      or from within an application (see <link idref="usagepatterns">Usage Patterns</link>).</p>
<p>To perform a transformation from the command line or a script, do the following:</p>
 		<ol>
    <li><link idref="getstarted" anchor="download">Download &xslt4c;</link>.<br/><br/></li> 
    <li><link idref="getstarted" anchor="path">Set the path/library path</link> to include the Xalan executable and the Xalan and Xerces libraries.<br/><br/></li>
    <li>Call the Xalan executable with the appropriate flags and arguments (described below).</li>
  </ol>  
</s2><anchor name="xalanexe"/>
<s2 title="Using the Xalan executable">
<p>Call the Xalan executable as follows:<br/><br/> 
<code>Xalan <ref>[options]</ref> <ref>xmlSource</ref> <ref>xslStylesheet</ref></code><br/><br/>
where <ref>xmlSource</ref> is the XML source document, <ref>xslStylesheet</ref> is the stylesheet to apply, and <ref>[options]</ref> are any (or none) of the following:</p>
<table>
 <tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>-a</td><td>Use stylesheet processing instruction, not the stylesheet argument.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>-e encoding</td><td>Force the specified encoding for the output.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>-i integer</td><td>Indent the specified amount.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>-m</td><td>Omit the META tag in HTML output.</td></tr>
 <tr><td>-o filename</td><td>Write transformation result to this file (rather than to the console).</td></tr>
 <tr><td>-p name expr</td><td>Set a stylesheet parameter with this expression.</td></tr> 
 <tr><td>-t name expr</td><td>Diplay timing information.</td></tr> 
 <tr><td>-u name expr</td><td>Disable escaping of URLs in HTML output.</td></tr> 
 <tr><td>-v</td><td>Validate the XML source document.</td></tr> 
 <tr><td>-</td><td>A dash as the 'source' argument reads from stdin.<br/>A dash as the 'stylesheet' argument reads from stdin.<br/>('-' cannot be used for both arguments.)</td></tr> 
 </table>
 <p>To display a list of the options call the Xalan executable as follows:</p>
<p><code>Xalan -?</code></p>
