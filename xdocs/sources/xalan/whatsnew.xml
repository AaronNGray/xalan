<s3 title="Changes for &xslt4c; version 1.9">
<p>Major updates since version 1.8 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pluggable Memory Management.  This feature allows applications to maintain precise control over memory allocations.  This 
      will allow users, with knowledge of their application's characteristics, to provide a more efficient allocation method 
      than the general purpose procedures provided by the system.</li>
  <li>Improved performance on stylesheet execution.  Because the current implementation relies on function recursion, certain
      stylesheets/input documents may cause the program stack to overflow and cause the application to fail.  It also may 
      inhibit executing stylesheets that are heavily dependent on recursive functions.  This feature will prevent these types 
      of failure. </li>
  <li>Upgrade from Xerces-C 2.5 to Xerces-C 2.6. </li>

<s3 title="Bug reporting">
<p>All known &xslt4c; bugs are listed in <resource-ref idref="jira"/>. For a list of open bugs with links to each bug
   report, see <resource-ref idref="buglist"/>. If you find a new bug, please enter a XalanC bug report in this
   database.</p>
<note>Before you can enter your first bug report, you must submit your email address to JIRA and receive a password.</note> 
<p>We strongly encourage you write patches for problems you find and submit them to
   xalan-dev@xml.apache.org. We review the patches we receive to make sure they do not break something else, and (assuming they 
   do not) include them in our next release. In the interest of fixing bugs, adding enhancements, and addressing outstanding design
   issues, we sincerely want (and need!) your active participation in the ongoing development of Xalan.</p>
