  <s2 title="Introduction">
    <p>&xslt4c; (named after a rare musical instrument) implements the <resource-ref idref="XSLT"/> and the 
    <resource-ref idref="XPath"/>. XSLT is the first part of the XSL stylesheet language for XML. It includes the XSL
     Transformation vocabulary and XPath, a language for addressing parts of XML documents. For links to background materials, 
    discussion groups, frequently asked questions, and tutorials on XSLT, see <link anchor="uptospeed">Getting up
    to speed with XSLT</link>.</p> 
    <note>XSL also includes a vocabulary for formatting documents, which is still under design and is not part of &xslt4c;. 
    For more information, see <jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/">W3C XSL Working Draft</jump> and the <jump
    href="http://xml.apache.org/fop">Apache XML FOP (Formatting Objects Project)</jump>.</note>
    <p>You use the XSLT language to compose XSL stylesheets. An XSL stylesheet contains instructions for
     transforming XML documents from one document type to another document type (XML, HTML, or other). In structural
     terms, an XSL stylesheet specifies the transformation of one tree of nodes (the XML input) into another tree of nodes 
     (the output or transformation result).</p>
    <note>The XSL stylesheet may generate and refer to cascading style sheets (CSS) as part of its output.</note>  
    <p>In the following example, the foo.xsl stylesheet is used to transform foo.xml into foo.out:</p>
<p>foo.xml:</p>
<source>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?>
&lt;doc>Hello&lt;/doc></source>
<p>foo.xsl:</p>
<source>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?> 
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">
&lt;xsl:template match="doc">
&lt;out>&lt;xsl:value-of select="."/>&lt;/out>
&lt;/xsl:template>
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet></source>
<p>foo.out:</p>
<source>&lt;out>Hello&lt;/out></source>

   	  <s2 title="&xslt4c; Features">
	    <ul> 
		    <li>With a few minor exceptions, &xslt4c; fully implements the <resource-ref idref="XSLT"/>.<br/><br/>
        For a list of the XSLT features that &xslt4c; does not yet implement, see <link idref="readme" anchor="to-do">&xslt4c;
        to-do tasks</link>.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>&xslt4c; incorporates the <resource-ref idref="XPath"/>.<br/><br/></li>
    	  <li>&xslt4c; uses <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html">&xml4c;</jump> to parse XML documents and XSL
        stylesheets.<br/><br/>
        The input may appear in the form of a file or URL, a stream, or a <resource-ref idref="DOM"/>. 
        &xslt4c; performs the transformations specified in the XSL stylesheet and produces a file, a stream, or a DOM as you
        specify when you set up the transformation.<br/><br/></li>
        <li>Along with a complete API for performing transformations in your C++ applications, &xslt4c; provides a <link
        idref="commandline">command line</link> utility for convenient file-to-file transformations.<br/><br/></li>

        <label>XSLT Namespace</label>
        <item>The <jump href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">XML namespace</jump> for XSLT. An XML namespace is a 
        collection of element and attribute names, identified by a Unique Resource Identifier (URI), which often takes the form of
        a URL, but is really just a unique string, not a pointer to a web page. The XSLT namespace URI is
        http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform. In each XSLT stylesheet, you must declare this namespace in the stylesheet element
        tag and bind it to a local prefix. Like the XSLT specification, we always use xsl as the XSLT namespace prefix in our
        descriptions and examples, although you are free to bind any prefix to this namespace.<br/><br/></item>
        
        <label>XSL Instruction</label>
        <item>Any tag associated with the XSLT namespace.<br/><br/></item>
        
        <label>Template</label>
        <item>An element, usually with child elements, that specifies a "rule" or set of 
        instructions to perform when a particular kind of node is encountered in the source tree.<br/><br/></item>
                
        <label>XSL Template Instruction</label>
        <item>Any tag that occurs inside an xsl:template element and is associated with the XSLT namespace.<br/><br/></item>
                   
        <label>Source Tree</label>
        <item>The XML tree input to the XSL process.<br/><br/></item>
        
        <label>Result Tree</label>
        <item>The tree that is output by the XSL process.<br/><br/></item>
        
        <label>Stylesheet Tree</label>
        <item>The stylesheet tree produced from the XSL file.<br/><br/></item>
        
        <label>Match Pattern</label>
        <item>The part of a template that defines the kind(s) of nodes to which the template applies.<br/><br/></item>
