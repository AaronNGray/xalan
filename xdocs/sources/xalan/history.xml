<s3 title="Changes for &xslt4c; version 1.9">
<p>Major updates since version 1.8 include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pluggable Memory Management.  This feature allows applications to maintain precise control over memory allocations.  This 
      will allow users, with knowledge of their application's characteristics, to provide a more efficient allocation method 
      than the general purpose procedures provided by the system.  for more information on how to use this feature, please see
      the <link idref="programming" anchor="memory">Pluggable Memory Management</link> section of the Programming page.</li>
  <li>Improved stability on the execution of large stylesheets and XML documents.  Because the current implementation relies on 
      function recursion, certain stylesheets/input documents may cause the program stack to overflow and cause the application 
      to fail.  It also may inhibit executing stylesheets that are heavily dependent on recursive functions.  This feature will 
      prevent these types of failure. </li>
  <li>Provided a global option to pool all text node strings.  This feature allows developers to set a flag to determine if a 
      parsed source tree will pool the values of all of the text nodes in the XML document.  By doing so, this can result in a 
      significant reduction in memory usage, particularly if there are a lot of repeated values in text nodes.  Please see 
      the class descriptions for <jump href="apiDocs/classXalanSourceTreeDocument.html">XalanSourceTreeDocument</jump>,  
      <jump href="apiDocs/classXalanDefaultParsedSource.html">XalanDefaultParsedSource</jump>, and
      <jump href="apiDocs/classXalanTransformer.html">XalanTransformer</jump> in the <jump href="apiDocs/index.html">
      API Reference</jump> section for more information.</li> 
  <li>Added support for Microsoft Studio .NET V7.1.  Project files for Microsoft Studio .NET V7.1 have been provided under the 
      directory xml-xalan\c\Projects\Win32\VC7.1.</li>
  <li>Upgrade from Xerces-C 2.5 to Xerces-C 2.6. </li>
 </ul>  
</s3>

   <s3 title="Changes for &xslt4c; version 1.8">
     <p>Major updates since version 1.7 include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Upgrade from Xerces-C 2.4 to Xerces-C 2.5. </li>
      <li>Provide build support for Cygwin and HP-UX 11.00 on Itanium.  Although binary distributions are not provided for the Cygwin environment and 
          HP-UX 11.00 on Itanium platform, the build configuration files provided in the source distribution can be used to build on these platforms. </li>
      <li>Project files for supporting Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.  Although a binary distribution for the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 
          is not provided in this release, Visual Studio solution files are provided in the Windows source distribution for those who choose to build
          on this platform.  Please see <link idref="build_instruct" anchor="dotNet">"Step for doing a Windows Build with Visual Studio .NET"</link> 
          for details.</li>
      <li>Additional changes to Xerces Deprecated DOM support.  This is another step towards phasing out the support for Xerces Deprecated DOM.  Users 
          are encouraged to modify their applications to interface with the new Xerces DOM support.  For more information on the effects of these 
          changes to your build environment, please see <link anchor="xercesdepdom">"Steps for doing a Build with Xerces Deprecated DOM Support"
          </link></li>
      <!--
      <li>Porting of conf utility to the UNIX platform.  The conf utility is a test harness designed to run the conformance tests located under the xml-xalan/test/tests directory.  After the tests have been run, a results report is generated in HTML format for easy viewing.  For more information on how to use this tool, please see <link idref="commandline" anchor="confexe">"Using the command line utility"</link>.</li>
      -->
      <li>Implemented optimizations to significantly improve the throughput of the ICU-enabled "format-number" function.</li>
      <li>Changes in the XML Serializer. The serializer will no longer put a newline after the xml header tag unless indent="yes". See bugzilla 
          <jump href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24304">24304</jump> and 
          <jump href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=28386">28386</jump>.</li>
     </ul>  
   </s3>  
   <s3 title="Changes for &xslt4c; version 1.7">
     <p>Major updates since version 1.6 include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>Message Localization Support. This feature enables &xslt4c; to issue diagnostic messages 
      in languages other than the default language (English). In order to utilize this feature, 
      the user must provide a version of the &xslt4c; message catalog that has been translated in 
      their language of choice. For more information on how to exploit this feature, please see  
      <link anchor="locale">Steps for doing a Build with Message Localization Support</link>.</li>
      <li>Build, packaging, and installation improvements. Changes to the &xslt4c; makefiles now 
      allow for a more flexible build, packaging, and install process. Each step in a typical 
      build process can be invoked by specifying the appropriate target, for example to build the 
      executable, and/or samples, or install the build at user-specified location. For more 
      information on building &xslt4c;, please see <link anchor="unix">Steps for doing a Unix build
      </link>.</li>
      <li>Deprecated DOM Support. The XercesBridge classes have been marked deprecated and moved 
      into an exclusive directory within the xalanc/XercesParserLiaison directory called 
      'Deprecated'. If your application is dependent on these classes to interface with the 
      deprecated Xerces DOM you must alter your include directive with the 'Deprecated' directory. 
      For example:<br/><br/>
      <code>#include "xalanc/XercesParserLiaison/XercesDocumentBridge.hpp"</code><br/><br/>
      should be changed to:<br/><br/>
      <code>#include "xalanc/XercesParserLiaison/Deprecated/XercesDocumentBridge.hpp"</code><br/><br/></li>
      <li>Upgrade from Xerces-C 2.3 to Xerces-C 2.4. </li>
      <li>Porting of ThreadSafe example to UNIX platform.</li>
      <li>Implementation of EXSLT string extension functions encode-uri() and decode-uri(). </li>
      <li>Implementation of EXSLT dynamic extension function evaluate(). </li>
      <li>Implementation of EXSLT date-time extension function date-time().</li>
     </ul>  
   </s3>  

   <s3 title="Changes for &xslt4c; version 1.6">
     <p>Major updates since version 1.5 include:</p>
     <ul>
	<li>Directory "sane include" reorganization.  A new sub-directory called &apos;xalanc&apos; has been added to the src directory (for source distribution packages) and include directory (for binary distribution packages).  New source files which include Xalan headers will need to be modified to include the 'xalanc' prefix in the header path.  
            For example: <br/><br/>
            <code>#include &lt;XPath/XObject.hpp&gt;</code><br/><br/>
            will need to be changed to <br/><br/>
            <code>#include &lt;xalanc/XPath/XObject.hpp&gt;</code><br/><br/>
            For Windows users, all project files have been modified to reflect this change.  For UNIX users, please see <link anchor="unix">Steps for doing a UNIX build</link> for migration considerations.</li>
     </ul>  
   </s3>

     <p>Major updates since version 1.4 include:</p>
     <ul>
	<li>For Windows, Xalan-C++ is now packaged as a single DLL.  The project files to build separate DLLs are now deprecated and will not be maintained.</li>

     </ul>  
   </s3>  
   <s3 title="Changes for &xslt4c; version 1.4">
     <p>Major updates since version 1.3 include:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>The &xslt4c; distributions no longer include the &xml4c; headers and libraries. Accordingly, you must download the appropriate &xml4c; distribution (see <link idref="getstarted" anchor="download">Downloading what you need</link>.</li>
       <li>64-bit build for HP-11; <link anchor="64">untested 64-bit support</link> for Solaris and AIX.</li>

       <li>A new and simplified command-line utility: <link idref="commandline" anchor="xalanexe">the Xalan executable</link></li>
       <li>New XPath samples exploiting the XPathEvaluator C API and illustrating serialization of an XPath result set: <link idref="samples" anchor="simplexpathcapi">SimpleXPathCAPI</link> and <link idref="samples" anchor="serializenodeset">SerializeNodeSet</link></li>
