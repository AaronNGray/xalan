  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>Xalan is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML
     document types.</p>
    <p>&xslt4c-current; is a robust implementation of the W3C Recommendations 
    for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath). It works with a compatible release of the 
    &xml4c; XML parser: &xml4c-used;. The focus for this release is on bug fixes, build and packaging improvements, and a number of new features such as Message Localization Support and additional EXSLT extension functions. For the details, see the <link idref="readme">Release Notes</link>.</p>
