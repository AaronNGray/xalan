<s1 title="Xalan-C++ Version 0.30.0">
      
  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>Xalan is an XSL processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML document types. Xalan-C++
     version 0.30.0 represents an almost complete and a robust C++ reference implementation of the W3C Recommendations for XSL
     Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath).</p>
    <p>Xalan-C uses the Xerces-C XML parser.</p>
	</s2>
  
  <s2 title="How do I get it?">
    <p>Download and unzip the distribution file for your platform. In addition to the platform-specific binaries,
    documentation, and sample applications, both distributions also include the complete Xalan-C source tree.</p>

  </tr>
  </table>
  <p>We plan to add builds for other platforms as soon as possible. Volunteers are more than welcome!</p>
  </s2>
  
  <s2 title="Where do I get Xerces?">
    <p>Both distributions include the Xerces runtime environment for Xalan -- xerces-c_1_1.dll for Windows,
     and libxerces-c_1_1.so for Linux. To build applications with Xalan and Xerces, you also need the &xml4c;
     binary distribution for your platform, which you can download from the  
     <resource-ref idref="Xerces-c-dist"/>.</p>
     <note>Be sure you are using a compatible Xerces-C build. For information about the build with which this release
     of Xalan-C was tested, see <link idref="readme" anchor="status">Version of Xerces to use</link>.</note>
  </s2>

    <p>For more information, go to the <link idref="overview">Xalan-C Overview</link> and 
    <link idref="getstarted">Getting Started with Xalan-C</link>. All of the Xalan documentation on this website is
    included in the Xalan downloads, as are a number of samples to help you start using Xalan to transform XML
    documents.</p>
