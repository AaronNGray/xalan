  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>Xalan is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML
     document types.</p>
    <p>&xslt4c-current; is a robust implementation of the W3C Recommendations 
    for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath). It works with a compatible release of the 
    &xml4c; XML parser: &xml4c-used;. The focus for this release is on bug fixes, a new sample that shows how to wrap pre-built Xerces DOM input and XalanSourceTree input, and beta support for a number of EXSLT extension functions. For the details, see the <link idref="readme">Release Notes</link>.</p>
	</s2>
  
  <s2 title="How do I get it?">
    <p>Download and unzip the &xslt4c; distribution file and the corresponding &xml4c; distributions file for your platform. For the details, see <link idref="getstarted" anchor="download">Downloading what you need</link>. The &xslt4c; distribution includes platform-specific binaries, documentation, sample applications, the complete &xslt4c; source tree.</p>
    <p>A source-only distribution is also available, if you want to build your own binaries.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="How about support for internationalization?">
    <p>To extend Unicode support for encoding, number formatting, and sorting, you can download,
     build, and integrate the <resource-ref idref="icu"/> with &xslt4c;. See
     <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>.</p>
