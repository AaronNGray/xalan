<s1 title="Xalan-C Version 1.0.0">
      
  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>Xalan is an XSL processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML document types. Xalan-C version
    1.0.0 represents a complete and a robust C++ reference implementation of the W3C Recommendations for XSL Transformations
    (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath).</p>
    <p>Xalan-C uses the Xerces-C XML parser.</p>
	</s2>
  
  <s2 title="How do I get it?">
    <p>Download and unzip either of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><jump href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-j/xalan-j_1_0_1.zip">xalan-j_1_0_0.zip</jump></li>
      <li><jump href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/xalan-j/xalan-j_1_0_1.tar.gz">xalan-j_1_0_0.tar.gz</jump></li>
    </ul> 
  </s2>
  
  <s2 title="Where do I get Xerces?">
    <p>The Xalan-C dowload includes xerces-c_1_1.dll from Xerces-C 1.0.3. This provides the Xerces runtime environment for
     Xalan.To build applications with Xalan and the Xerces XML parser, you also need the Xerces-C source tree, which you can
     obtain by downloading the Xerces-C Source distribution from the <resource-ref idref="Xeces-c-dist"/>.</p>
  </s2>  
    <s2 title="For more information...">
    <p>For more information, go to <link idref="overview">Xalan Overview</link> and <link idref="getstarted">Getting
    Started</link>. All of the Xalan documentation on this website is included in the Xalan download, as are a number of samples
    to help you start using Xalan to transform XML documents.</p>
