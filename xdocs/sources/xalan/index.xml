  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>Xalan is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML
     document types.</p>
    <p>&xslt4c-current; is a robust implementation of the W3C Recommendations 
    for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath). It includes a compatible release of the 
    &xml4c; XML parser: &xml4c-used;. The focus for this release is on bug fixes, along with a new and simpler command-line executable, 
    two new samples and additional support for using a Xerces DOM as input for a transformation. For the details, see the <link idref="readme">Release Notes</link>.</p>

  <s2 title="Where do I get Xerces?">
    <p>Right here! The distributions include everything you need to build and run applications that use Xalan and Xerces. Each distribution
     file includes the Xerces distribution with the appropriate Xerces runtime environment for Xalan: &xml4c-windll; for
     Windows, &xml4c-linuxlib; for Linux, &xml4c-aixlib; for AIX, &xml4c-hplib; for HP-UX 11, and &xml4c-solarislib; for Solaris.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="How about support for internationalization?">
    <p>To extend Unicode support for encoding, number formatting, and sorting, you can download,
     build, and integrate the <resource-ref idref="icu"/> with &xslt4c;. See
     <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>.</p>
