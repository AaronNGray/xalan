  <s2 title="What is it?">
    <p>Xalan is an XSLT processor for transforming XML documents into HTML, text, or other XML
     document types.</p>
    <p>&xslt4c-current; represents a robust C++ reference implementation of the W3C Recommendations 
    for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath). It uses the latest release of
     the &xml4c; XML parser (&xml4c-used;).</p>
	</s2>
  
  <s2 title="How do I get it?">
    <p>Download and unzip the distribution file for your platform. In addition to the platform-specific binaries,
    documentation, and sample applications, both distributions also include the complete &xslt4c; source tree.</p>
     <table>
       <tr>
         <td><em>Platform</em></td>
         <td><em>Download</em></td>

      </tr>
     </table>
  <p>Volunteers are more than welcome to help develop builds for other platforms!</p>
  </s2>
  
  <s2 title="Where do I get Xerces?">
    <p>The distributions include the Xerces runtime environment for Xalan: &xml4c-windll; for
     Windows, &xml4c-linuxlib; for Linux, and &xml4c-aixlib; for AIX.</p>
     <p>To build applications with Xalan and Xerces, you also need the &xml4c; binary distribution
     for your platform, which you can download from the <resource-ref idref="xml4c-distdir"/>.</p>
     <note>Be sure you are using a compatible Xerces-C++ build. For information about the build with
     which this release of Xalan-C++ was tested, see <link idref="readme" anchor="status">Version of
     Xerces to use</link>.</note>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="How about extending support for internationalization?">
    <p>To extend Unicode support for encoding, number formatting, and sorting to more than 150
     locales, you can download, build, and integrate the <resource-ref idref="icu"/> with &xslt4c;.
     For more information, see <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="icu">Using the ICU</link>.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="For more information...">
    <p>For more information, go to the <link idref="overview">Xalan-C++ Overview</link> and 
    <link idref="getstarted">Getting Started with Xalan-C++</link>. All of the Xalan documentation
    on this website is included in the Xalan downloads, as are a number of samples to help you start
    using Xalan to transform XML documents.</p>
