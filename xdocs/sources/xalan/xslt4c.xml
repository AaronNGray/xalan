<s1 title="Xalan C++ XSL Transformer">

  <s2 title="Xalan C++">
     <p>Like Xalan-J, Xalan-C implements <resource-ref idref="XSLT"/> and the <resource-ref idref="XPath"/>. 
     Version 0.30.0 is our second release, including builds for Win32 and Linux. You can download this release from the
     <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/dist/">Apache XML Distribution directory</jump></p>
     <p>The build includes 8 DLLs and an executable (TestXSLT.exe, a command-line utility). To use this utility 
     to perform transformations, place these files in a directory with the Xerces dynamic link library, xerces-c_1_0.dll.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="Command-line utility">  
    <p>&xslt4c; implements a subset of the same interface provided by &xslt4j;. This version accepts the following switches
    and arguments:</p> 
      <source>
-IN inputXMLURL
-XSL XSLTransformationURL
-OUT outputFileName
-E (Keep--do not expand -- entity refs)
-V (Version info)
-QC (Quiet Pattern Conflicts Warnings)
-Q  (Quiet Mode)
-INDENT (Number of spaces to indent each level in output tree -- default is 0)
-VALIDATE (Validate the XML and XSL input -- validation is off by default)
-XML (Use XML formatter and add XML header)
-TEXT (Use simple Text formatter)
-HTML (Use HTML formatter)
-PARAM name expression (Set a stylesheet parameter)</source>
      <p>Use -IN to specify the XML source document, -XSL to specify the XSL stylesheet, and -OUT to specify the
      output file.</p>
      <p>Use -TEXT if you want the output to include only element values (not element tags with element names and
      attributes). Use -HTML to write 4.0 transitional HTML (some elements, such as &lt;br&gt;, are
      not well formed.</p>
      <p>To set stylesheet parameters from the command line, use -PARAM name expression. If 
      you want to set the parameter to a string value, enclose the string in single quotes (') to
      make it an expression.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="API">
    <p>The API documentation, generated using Doc++ from comments in the header files, is still in very preliminary form. For example,
    it lists public classes, class members, and functions, but does not yet identify which of these are exported. 
    With this in mind, see <jump href="c-apidocs/index.html">Xalan C++ API: Main Page</jump>.</p>
  </s2>
  <s2 title="&xslt4c; Features">
	    <ul> 
		    <li>Implements the <resource-ref idref="XSLT"/> and the <resource-ref idref="XPath"/></li> 
    	  <li>Uses the &xml4c; XML parser></li>
    	  <li>Can output to SAX or DOM</li>
