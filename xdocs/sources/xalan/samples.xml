	<s2 title="Samples to help you get started">
    <p>Each of the subdirectories in the &xslt4j; samples directory contains the source files for a
    sample application. The executables for all the samples are in  the xxx directory, so to run the samples, 
    you should place this directory on the system path.</p>
    <p>With most of the samples, you can use the following procedure:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Go to the samples subdirectory containing the sample (use the DOS shell if you are running Windows)
      <br/><br/></li>
      <li>Run the sample from the command line (as indicated below)<br/><br/></li>
      <li>Examine the application source files. You may also want to modify the source files. Remember that if you
      modify a .cpp file, you must rebuild the executable and place it on the path before you can run the
      modified application.</li>
     </ol>      
    <p>The basic command line for running samples is </p> 
    <p><code><ref>executable</ref></code></p>
    <p>or</p>
    <p><code><ref>executable args</ref></code></p>
    <p>where <ref>executable</ref> is the name of the executable and <ref>args</ref> are the arguments.</p>
  </s2><anchor name="simpletransform"/>
  <s2 title="SimpleTransform">
    <p>What it does: The SimpleTransform class uses the foo.xsl stylesheet to transform foo.xml, and prints the
     output to foo.out.</p>
    <p>You can run it from the SimpleTransform subdirectory with</p>
    <p><code>SimpleTransform</code></p>
    <p>See also: <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="basic">Basic proecedures for performing XSL
    transformations</link>.</p>
  </s2><anchor name="usestylesheetparam"/>    
  <s2 title="UseStylesheetParam">    
    <p>What it does: Set a stylesheet parameter that the stylesheet uses during the transformation.</p>
    <p>You can run it from the UseStylesheetParam subdirectory with</p>
    <p><code>UseStylesheetParam <ref>key expression</ref></code></p>
    <p>where <ref>key</ref> is the parameter key (or name) and <ref>expression</ref> is a string expression enclosed
     in single quotes.</p>
    <p>The example uses a stylesheet (foo.xsl) with a parameter named param1. The stylesheet accepts any string
     expression. Enclose the string expression in single quotes (so it is interpreted as an expression); if it
     includes more than a single word, enclose the resulting string in double quotes so the executable interprets it
     as a single argument. For example:</p>
     <p><code>UseStylesheetParam param1 "'this is a mulit-word string expression'"</code></p>
     <p>See also: <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="params">Setting stylesheet params</link>.</p>     
  </s2><anchor name="compilestylesheet"/>    
  <s2 title="CompileStylesheet">
    <p>What it does: Use a compiled stylesheet to perform a series of transformations.</p>
    <p>You can run it from the CompileStylesheet subdirectory with</p>
    <p><code>CompileStylesheet</code></p>
    <p>See also: <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="compiled">Compiling stylesheets</link>.</p>
  </s2><anchor name="xpathwrapper"/>
  <s2 title="XPathWrapper">
    <p>This sample uses TestDriver, an executable, and two classes: XPathWrapper and XPathWrapperImp. </p>
    <p>What it does: TestDriver passes XPathWrapper an XML file name, a context node location path, and an XPath
    expression. XPathWrapper in turn passes these arguments to the XPahtWrapperImpl evaluate() method, which executes
    the XPath expression from specified context node in the XML document and returns the nodes (if any) it finds.</p>
     <note>You can use this sample as an aid when you want to find out what a given XPath expression returns from a
     given context node in an XML file.</note>
    <p>Run this sample from the XPathWrapper subdirectory with</p> 
    <p><code>TestDriver <ref>XMLFile ContextNode XPathExpression</ref></code></p>
    <p>where <ref>XMLFile</ref> is an XML source file, <ref>ContextNode</ref> is the location path to the context
     node, and <ref>XPathExpression</ref> is an XPath expression to apply to that context node. The XPathWrapper
     subdirectory contains an XML file named xml.foo (part of it appears below).</p>
     <source>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;doc&gt;
  &lt;name first="David" last="Marston"/&gt;
  &lt;name first="David" last="Bertoni"/&gt;
  ...
  &lt;name first="Paul" last="Dick"/&gt;
&lt;/doc&gt;</source>
     <p>You can try command lines like</p>
    <p><code>TestDriver foo.xml /doc name/@last</code></p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p><code>TestDriver foo.xml //name[position()="4" ./@first</code></p>
    <p>See also: <link idref="usagepatterns" anchor="xpath">Working with XPath expressions</link>.</p>    
  </s2><anchor name="externalfunctions"/>
  <s2 title="ExternalFunctions">
    <p>What it does: implement, install, and illustratethe usage of three extension functions. The functions return a
    square root, a cube, and a string with the current date and time. The sample stylesheet (foo.xsl) gets the area
    of a cube and units of measurement from an XML document (foo.xml), computes the length of each side
    of a cube and the volume of the cube, and enters the date and time of the transformation. The output appears in
    foo.out.</p>
    <p>Run this sample from the ExternalFunctions subdirectory with</p> 
    <p><code>ExternalFunctions</code></p>
    <p>See also: <link idref="extensions">Extension Functions</link>.</p>
