README for xml-xalan/C++ project at apache.org


Basic Build Instructions for xml-xalan/c:

- We currently have checked in project files for MSVC++ 6.0.  Load and build the "TestXSLT" subproject from
Projects\Win32\VC6\Xalan.dsw.  Note that the STL headers are very noisy in MSVC with hundreds of warnings that 
can be safely ignored.  Once you're built, copy the DLL's (8 of them) and the testXSLT.exe executable into a directory
containing the xerces-c_1_0 DLL from Xerces.  Then run.  The command line is the same as Xalan/J.
